# Curve Stripping

-----------

A proof-of-concept for using curve stripping to obtain initial estimates for a 2 compartment PK model

Currently uses IV-bolus curve stripping formulas, even for oral absorption model, however with rich sampling initial estimates are still close enough that can fine-tune with initial estimates slider (phoenix) or run a naive pooled analysis to finalize.
